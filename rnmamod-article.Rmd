date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
abstract: >
  A plethora of R packages are available for performing network meta-analysis,
  significantly boosting the popularity of this evidence synthesis methodology. 
  These R packages enable the implementation of the most 
  proposed statistical models for carrying out and evaluating network meta-analysis, 
  yielding essential results that adhere to reporting standards such as the PRISMA-NMA statement. The rnmamod 
  package is a novel contribution to the field of aggregate data network meta-analysis 
  using Bayesian methods, allowing for the proper handling of missing participant data  
  in all models, even in cases where only a handful of the included studies report this information. 
  Rnmamod is the first R package to offer a comprehensive and user-friendly 
  visualisation toolkit, transforming the information-rich output of network 
  meta-analysis into a set of comprehensive graphs. Additionally, this  package simplifies the process of 
  thoroughly appraising and interpretating the results, supporting cross-comparisons between
  different models and streamlining the preparation of manuscripts for journal submission.

# Introduction

Evidence-based medicine forms the backbone of informed decisions for the benefit of the patients, arising from a meticulous and judicious use of the available evidence. This concept incorporates clinical experience and patient values on the basis of the most up-to-date and reliable scientific evidence[@EvidenceBasedMedicine]. 
However, the medical community is confronted daily with vast amount of clinical evidence to keep pace with, which poses challenges to the optimal practice of evidence-based medicine [@Lee2022].
Systematic reviews with pairwise meta-analysis summarise the evidence of a pair of interventions, providing fragmented evidence that does not serve the clinical needs of treatment recommendations based on a plethora of available options. 
Moreover, evidence regarding the comparability of different interventions at the trial level is also fragmented, as it is impractical to compare all intervention options for a particular condition in a single trial. These limitations led to the development and subsequent establishment of network meta-analysis (NMA), also known as multiple treatment comparison — a new generation evidence synthesis tool [@Salanti2012]. Network  meta-analysis is the extension of pairwise meta-analysis, collating all relevant evidence for a specific condition, patient population, and intervention options. The purpose is to provide coherent evidence for all possible intervention comparisons, and allow the ranking of the investigated interventions from the most to the least effective for a given outcome [@Caldwell2014]. Indirect evidence (obtained from different sets of trials sharing a common investigated intervention/comparator) plays a central role in the development and prominence of NMA. 

Ever since the introduction of indirect evidence and the initial development of the corresponding methodology (Higgins and Whitehead 1996; Bucher et al. 1997), the NMA framework has made 
significant conceptual and methodological progress. The rapid publications of pertinent methodological papers and systematic reviews involving multiple interventions bears witness to the growing popularity of NMA within the broad medical and evidence synthesis community (Efthimiou et al. 2016; Petropoulou et al. 2017). The availability of statistical analysis software has been the driving force behind the progress and widespread dissemination of NMA. A comprehensive review of NMA methodology and software (Efthimiou et al. 2016) listed several statistical software tools that have been instrumental in promoting NMA. Among these tools, the \textbf{R} software (R Core Team 2023) takes the lead as the most widely utilized, followed by \textbf{Stata} (StataCorp 2021) and \textbf{SAS software} (SAS Institute 2020). In the past decade, there has been a surge in the development of R packages tailored for NMA, each offering distinct functionalities (Dewey and Viechtbauer 2023).

Most methodological studies and systematic reviews involving NMA have employed Bayesian methods [@GetRealNMA; @Petropoulou2017], benefiting from the flexibility, uncertainty management, and external data integration of the Bayesian framework [@Sutton2001]. The BUGS software dominance [@Lunn2009] during the springtime of the NMA framework, may have contributed to the growing popularity of Bayesian NMA. The numerous Bayesian NMA R packages also demonstrate the recognition of Bayesian methods within the evidence synthesis community [@CRANTaskReview]. The rest of the section delves into R packages for 
Bayesian NMA published in the __CRAN Task View 'Meta-Analysis'__ [@CRANTaskReview] 
featuring a wide range of methodological and reporting functionalities: \CRANpkg{bnma} [@bnma], 
\CRANpkg{gemtc} [@gemtc], \CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} [@pcnetmeta], and \CRANpkg{rnmamod} 
[@rnmamod] (a recent novel contribution).

The R packages \CRANpkg{bnma} [@bnma], \CRANpkg{gemtc} [@gemtc], and \CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} 
[@pcnetmeta] perform hierarchical NMA using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 
through the __JAGS__ program [@Plummer2003]. However, they differ in terms of their 
methodological and reporting scope: the former two share a greater common basis in methods and outputs 
than \CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} [@pcnetmeta]. This may be attributed to adoption of difference modelling approaches.
\CRANpkg{bnma} [@bnma] and \CRANpkg{gemtc} [@gemtc] employ the contrast-based approach, where
trial-specific relative effects, such as log odds ratio, are 
pooled across trials. This is the most established approach to meta-analysis, while
\CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} [@pcnetmeta] adopts the arm-based modeling approach, where 
arm-specific results, such as log odds, are pooled across trials. This approach
deviates from the standard meta-analysis practice [@Dias2016] and is less widespread. 

Currently, the \CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} [@pcnetmeta] package lacks functions for performing inconsistency evaluation  and meta-regression. Also, it is limited to only rankograms in terms of hierarchy
measures [@Salanti2022], and considers solely trace plots as a visual diagnostic tool. 
On the contrary, \CRANpkg{bnma} [@bnma] and \CRANpkg{gemtc} [@gemtc] offer at least 
one method for inconsistency evaluation and meta-regression, and provide a wider variety of hierarchy measures and diagnostic tools. All three R packages provide a compact toolkit 
of functions for presenting the relative treatment effects results: a league 
table for one outcome, typically displayed only in the console, and a forest-plot or table 
on the relative treatment effects of all comparisons versus a selected reference intervention.
Moreover, these packages provide most output using the `print()` function (the results appear in the 
console) than utilising visualisation. Consequently, the results are often presented in isolation, thereby limiting the ability to gain further insights into the performance of the different NMA models 
(e.g, assuming consistency versus inconsistency). 

Given the complexity and the broad scope of NMA, researchers are faced with 
a substantial volume of results that are essential for understanding the evidence base. This involves
evaluating underlying assumptions and assessing the quality of the estimated parameters (via model 
diagnostics) to properly provide a response to the investigated research question. 
The aforementioned R packages have limited functionalities when it comes to presentation of NMA results.
As a result, meticulously examining and critically appraising the results, a necessary requirement to ensure the transparency of conclusions delivered to the end users of systematic reviews including multiple interventions, presents a considerable challenge.
Furthermore, an overreliance on the R console limits the usability of the results. R users are required to resort to tabulation, which hampers comprehension, especially when analysing extensive intervention networks that inherently yield an immense amount of results. Alternatively, R users must write functions to produce thenecessary visualisations, a time-consuming process that heavily relies on the user's programming skills in R.
The R  package __rnmamod__ [@rnmamod], recently published in the Comprehensive R Archive 
Network (available at 
[https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnmamod](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnmamod)),
aspires to fill this technical gap by offering a rich, dynamic, user-friendly 
visualisation toolkit that transforms the inherently dense output of NMA into a collection of  
coherent graphs. Originally, the __rnmamod__ package was inspired by the absence of dedicated 
R packages that properly account for (aggregate) missing participants in the analyses 
underlying the NMA framework (e.g., core model, inconsistency assessment, and 
meta-regression). 

The article introduces the R package __rnmamod__ that performs Bayesian 
hierarchical NMA in JAGS through the R package \CRANpkg{R2jags} [@R2jags]
while modeling missing participants using one-stage pattern-mixture models [@Little1993].
The package's visualisation functionalities have been developed using the R package 
\CRANpkg{ggplot2} [@ggplot2], harnessing the flexibility it offers in creating 
and customising high-quality graphs. The rest of this article is structured as 
follows. Section [2](#Pattern-mixture-models-for-aggregate-binary-and-continuous-outcomes) 
provides an overview of the pattern-mixture models for aggregate binary and continuous 
outcome data within the context of NMA. Section [3](#The-architecture-of-\pkg{rnmamod}) 
outlines the architecture of __rnmamod__. Section [4](#Bayesian-network-meta-analysis-model) 
describes the Bayesian network meta-analysis model and introduces the robustness 
index, a novel approach to investigate the sensitivity of the analysis results to 
different scenarios about the missing mechanism in the interventions of the investigated 
network [@SpineliRSM2021; @SpineliBMCMed2021]. 
In section [5](#Using-the-\pkg{rnmamod}-R-package) we illustrate the various functions of the package on example datasets from published systematic reviews with NMA. Finally, Section [6](#Discussion) 
concludes with a discussion of the limitations and future developments of the package. 

# Pattern-mixture model for aggregate binary and continuous outcomes

We briefly introduce the pattern-mixture model, initially proposed by Little [@Little1993], and extend it to aggregate-level binary and continuous outcomes within the evidence synthesis framework. The pattern-mixture model distinguishes participants into two groups:
those who completed the assigned intervention and those who prematurely left the intervention arm for various reasons. The former are referred to as _completers_ and the latter as
_missing participants_. Information is available only on the outcomes of the completers who remained in the assigned intervention until trial completion. When missing participants are not followed-up after leaving the trial, which is typically the case, their outcome can only be hypothesised with some uncertainty. Hence, we can determine a distribution of possible values to describe the hypothetical outcomes of missing participants in the assigned intervention. Ideally, this distribution should be elicited using an expert opinion regarding the investigated outcome and interventions [@White2007]. 
Then, the weighted average of the observed and hypothesised outcomes, with the proportion of completers and missing participants serving as the corresponding weights, yields the _true_ outcome for all randomised participants receiving the investigated intervention. This corresponds to the intention-to-treat analysis and is particularly valuable for assessing the impact of different scenarios regarding the distribution of hypothetical outcome values for the missing participants on the treatment effect. This sensitivity analysis lies at the core of the literature on properly handling missing data [@White2007; @Carpenter2007; @NationalResearchCouncil].

Consider a set of $N$ trials collected through a systematic review process. These trials investigate different sets of two or more carefully selected interventions for a specific target population and clinical condition. We extract data on the number randomised participants, the number of completers and missing participants, and the measured outcome from each arm of every trial. The pattern-mixture framework simultaneously models completers and missing participants, while preserving the randomised
sample, as follows:

$$
\theta_{ik} = \theta^{c}_{ik} \times (1 - q_{ik}) + \theta^{m}_{ik} \times q_{ik} 
\tag{1}
$$

where $\theta_{ik}$ is the true outcome in arm $k$ of trial $i$, $\theta^{c}_{ik}$
and $\theta^{m}_{ik}$ are the outcomes among the completers and missing participants,
respectively (the superscripts $c$ and $m$ stand for completers and missing), and 
$q_{ik}$ is the proportion of missing participants. It holds that 

$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{ik} &= P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 1 \cup M_{ikj} = 0) \\
\theta^{c}_{ik} &= P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 0) \\
\theta^{m}_{ik} &= P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 1) \\
\end{aligned}$$

for a binary outcome, and 

$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{ik} &= E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 1 \cup M_{ikj} = 0) \\
\theta^{c}_{ik} &= E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 0) \\
\theta^{m}_{ik} &= E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 1) \\
\end{aligned}$$

for a continuous outcome, with $I_{ikj}$ and $M_{ikj}$ being dummy variables 
referring to whether a participant $j$ experienced the outcome or left the trial
prematurely, respectively, and $Y_{ikj}$ referring to the continuous outcome of 
participant $j$.

## Informative missingness parameters

It has been suggested in the relevant published literature to express the missingness 
parameter $\theta^{m}_{ik}$ as a function of an informative missingness parameter $\phi_{ik}$, a difference of the outcome in completers and missing participants [@White2008; @Mavridis2015; @Turner2015]:

$$\begin{aligned}
\phi_{ik} = logit(\theta^{m}_{ik}) - logit(\theta^{c}_{ik})
\end{aligned}$$

the informative missingness odds ratio (IMOR) in the logarithmic scale for binary 
outcomes [@White2008; @Turner2015], and 

$$\begin{aligned}
\psi_{ik} = \theta^{m}_{ik} - \theta^{c}_{ik}
\end{aligned}$$

the informative missingness difference of means (IMDoM) for continuous outcomes 
[@Mavridis2015]. Additional informative missingness parameters proposed 
for binary outcomes include the response probability ratio [@Magder2003; @Turner2015], which is 
defined as the ratio of the probability of completing the trial given the event 
being experienced to the probability of completing the trial given the event
not being experienced,


$$\begin{aligned}
\omega_{ik} = \dfrac{P(M_{ikj} = 0 | I_{ikj} = 1)}{P(M_{ikj} = 0 | I_{ikj} = 0)}
\end{aligned}$$

and the success probability ratio [@Akl2013; @Turner2015] as the ratio of the 
probability of experiencing the outcome given the missing participants to the 
probability of experiencing the outcome given the completers,

$$\begin{aligned}
\rho_{ik} = \dfrac{\theta^{m}_{ik}}{\theta^{c}_{ik}} = \dfrac{P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 1)}{P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 0)}.
\end{aligned}$$

Finally, the informative missingness ratio of means (IMRoM) has also been proposed 
for continuous outcomes [@Mavridis2015], which is defined as the mean outcome given the 
missing participants to the mean outcome given the completers,

$$\begin{aligned}
e^{\zeta_{ik}} = \dfrac{\theta^{m}_{ik}}{\theta^{c}_{ik}} = \dfrac{E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 1)}{E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 0)}.
\end{aligned}$$

The response probability ratio [@Magder2003; @Turner2015] aligns better with a different approach for dealing with missing data, i.e., the selection model. This model distinguishes the participants based on their outcome and categorises them into those who completed the assigned intervention and those who left prematurely [@Little1995]. On the other hand, the success probability ratio [@Akl2013; @Turner2015] is more suited for use with the risk ratio, as it represents a ratio of risks. IMRoM is intuitively related to the ratio of means [@Mavridis2015]. Finally, IMOR and IMDoM are more commonly used in conjunction with the OR and the mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference, respectively.

The informative missingness parameters, IMDoM and IMOR, in the logarithmic scale (log IMOR), can take values in ${\rm I\!R}$, where a value zero implies the missing-at-random assumption (ignorable missingness), while non-zero values indicate the missing-not-at-random assumption (non-ignorable missingness). Essentially, these informative missingness parameters quantify deviations from the missing-at-random assumption. As these parameters are typically unknown, the analysts can consider one of the following situations:

* assign a fixed value, which corresponds to imputation [@Higgins2008; @Turner2015; @Spineli2019],
* assume a distribution with suggested parameter values and proceed with a two-stage approach to synthesise the trials using their adjusted treatment effects and variances for missing participants obtained through the Taylor series approximation in the first stage [@White2008; @Mavridis2015], or 
* use the Bayesian framework to estimate their posterior distribution via an one-stage approach to synthesise the trials [@Turner2015; @Spineli2019; @Spineli2021]. 

Typically, a normal distribution is assigned on the log IMOR, IMDoM and log IMRoM with mean and variance implying our belief and its corresponding uncertainty, respectively, about the missingness mechanism on average [@Higgins2008; @White2008; @Mavridis2015; @Turner2015; @Spineli2019; @Spineli2021]:

$$\begin{aligned}
\phi_{ik}, \psi_{ik}, \zeta_{ik} \sim N(b_{ik}, \kappa^{2}_{ik})
\end{aligned}$$

In the Bayesian framework, the analysts assign a prior normal distribution on these parameters and can determine the mean ($b_{ik}$) and variance ($\kappa^{2}_{ik}$) to be common across the trials and intervention arms, specific to the interventions or trials, as well as identical, hierarchical or independent [@Turner2015; @Spineli2019; @Spineli2021]. Table 
`r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(tab:table-one-interactive)', '\\@ref(tab:table-one)'))` presents the different structural specifications of log IMOR, IMDoM and log IMRoM. Informative structure makes the least strong assumption but it yields the most parameters to estimate. Identical is the most parsimonious structure but makes the strongest assumption. Lastly, hierarchical structure is the most flexible for allowing information to be 'borrowed', improving estimation. Deciding on the prior structure of the informative missingness parameter is not 
straightforward: the analysts need to consider the trade-off between clinical plausibility and model fit to avoid overfitting. There is already an empirical and simulation study on the properties of the aforementioned structural assumptions [@Spineli2019; @SpineliStatMed2019]. The authors provide recommendations to assist in selecting the proper structure, and they emphasise consulting expertise on the investigative health-field and intervention when determining the structure of the informative missingness parameter, ideally during the protocol stage of the systematic review [@Spineli2019; @SpineliStatMed2019]. The authors also highlight that further research is needed to demystify the properties of these structural assumptions [@Spineli2019; @SpineliStatMed2019]. The __rnmamod__ package allows the user to apply all structural specifications for log IMOR, IMDoM and log IMRoM. 

In this article, we will only consider IMOR and IMDoM due to their intuitive relationship to the aforementioned effect measures, which are also the most frequently employed in published systematic reviews and relevant methodological literature [@Friedrich2008; @Nikolakopoulou2014; @Bakbergenuly2019].

# Bayesian network meta-analysis model

Suppose the $N$ trials compare different sets of $T$ interventions ${A, B, C,..., T}$:
the network of interventions is made up of two-arm trials and probably multi-arm trials, as well, and the network is connected; namely, there is no intervention or group of interventions forming a separate network. For a binary outcome, we extract information on the number of participants who experienced the
outcome in arm $k$ ($k \ge 1$) of trial $i$ and completed the trial, $r^{c}_{ik}$, and the number of missing participants, $m_{ik}$, out of the total randomised, $n_{ik}$. Following the notation from the previous section, $r^{c}_{ik}$ and $m_{ik}$ are assumed to be sampled from the corresponding binomial distributions:

$$\begin{aligned}
r^{c}_{ik} \sim Binomial(\theta^{c}_{ik}, c_{ik})  
\end{aligned}$$

and

$$\begin{aligned}
m_{ik} \sim Binomial(q_{ik}, n_{ik})  
\end{aligned}$$

with $\theta^{c}_{ik}$ and $c_{ik}$ being the underlying probability of event among the completers and the number of completers, respectively, in arm $k$ of trial $i$. In the case of a continuous outcome, the extracted information pertains to the average outcome and variance thereof among those completing arm $k$ of trial $i$, $y^{c}_{ik}$ and $v^{c}_{ik}$, respectively, and $m_{ik}$ out of $n_{ik}$. 
Then, it can be assumed that $y^{c}_{ik}$ is samples from the following normal distribution:

$$\begin{aligned}
y^{c}_{ik} \sim N(\theta^{c}_{ik}, v^{c}_{ik})  
\end{aligned}$$

with $\theta^{c}_{ik}$ being the underlying mean of the continuous outcome among the completers in arm $k$ of trial $i$. 

Returning to the binary outcome, the underlying logit of an event in the experimental arm $k$ of trial $i$, $logit(\theta_{ik})$, is a function of the baseline logit of an event in trial $i$, $u_{i} = logit(\theta_{i1})$, and the odds ratio of event between arm $k$ and the baseline arm in the logarithmic scale, $\delta_{ik}$:

$$\begin{aligned}
logit(\theta_{ik}) = u_{i} + \delta_{ik} \times I\{k \ne 1\}   
\end{aligned}$$

The parameter $\theta_{ik}$ has been adjusted for missing participants using the pattern-mixture model (equation (1)) with $\phi_{ik}$ for informative missingness parameter under a specific prior structure and assumption about the missingness mechanism reflected by the mean of the prior distribution (see Table `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(tab:table-one-interactive)', '\\@ref(tab:table-one)'))`). 

The link function for the continuous outcome is the following:

$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{ik} = u_{i} + \delta_{ik} \times I\{k \ne 1\}      
\end{aligned}$$

with $\theta_{ik}$ and $u_{i} = \theta_{i1}$ being the underlying mean outcome in arm $k$ and baseline arm of trial $i$, respectively, and $\delta_{ik}$ being the MD between arm $k$ and baseline arm of the trial. When SMD is the effect measure, the link function is written as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{ik} = u_{i} + S_{i} \times \delta_{ik} \times I\{k \ne 1\}      
\end{aligned}$$

with $S_{i}$ being the pooled standard deviation under the MAR assumption when trial $i$ has missing participants. In this case, the variance of the outcome among the completers is assumed to be equal to the variance of the outcome among the missing participants [@Spineli2021]. To acknowledge the uncertainty about this assumption, $S_{i}$ is assumed to be sampled from the following gamma distribution [@Stevens2011; @Spineli2021]:

$$\begin{aligned}
S^{2}_{i} \sim \Gamma\left(\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{a_{i}}(n_{ik} - 1)}{2}, \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{a_{i}}(n_{ik} - 1)}{2 \times v^{c}_{ik}}\right)  
\end{aligned}$$

Like with the binary outcome, $\theta_{ik}$ has been adjusted for missing participants using the pattern-mixture model (equation (1)) with $\psi_{ik}$ for informative missingness parameter under a specific prior structure and assumption about the missingness mechanism reflected by the mean of the prior distribution (see Table `r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(tab:table-one-interactive)', '\\@ref(tab:table-one)'))`).

# The architecture of \pkg{rnmamod}

## Functions on data preparation and model implementation

The `run_model()` function plays a central role in the architecture of the __rnmamod__ package. It is responsible for fitting the core NMA model and related analyses to assess the underlying assumptions of NMA. It also comprises the R object for most functions used to create the necessary visualisations. 
Initially, `run_model()` calls  the `data_preparation()` function to prepare the format of the dataset for JAGS modelling appropriately. The dataset is provided in the one-study-per-row format, which is
typical for code written in the BUGS language. Then `run_model()` bundles the dataset along with the necessary parameters (previously processed through the `missingness_param_prior()`, `heterogeneity_param_prior()`, and `baseline_model()` functions) to conduct NMA through the `prepare_model()` function. The `prepare_model()` function contains the code in BUGS language for performing a hierarchical one-stage NMA, following the methodology published by the NICE Decision Support Unit in a series of tutorial papers on evidence synthesis methods for decision-making [@Dias2013]. The `missingness_param_prior()` and `heterogeneity_param_prior()` functions process the hyperparameters of the selected prior distribution for the informative missingness parameter and the  between-study heterogeneity parameter, respectively, preparing them for use by JAGS. The `baseline_model()` function is relevant only when dealing with binary outcomes. It processes the baseline risk defined by the user or the default option before performing NMA.

Subsequent analyses associated with the underlying assumptions of NMA are performed by specially devised functions that inherit most arguments from `run_model()`. Therefore, careful specification of the arguments in `run_model()` is essential for the contingent functions to yield sensible results and ensure meaningful comparison with the NMA results. These functions refer to the local and global 
consistency evaluation (`run_nodesplit()` and `run_ume()`), network meta-regression (`run_metareg()`), multiple pairwise meta-analyses (`run_series_meta()`) and sensitivity analysis to different missingness scenarios (`run_sensitivity()`) when the number of missing participants has been extracted for all study-arms. The functions `run_nodesplit()` and `run_ume()` call the `prepare_nodesplit()` and `prepare_ume()` functions, respectively, to fit the node-splitting and the unrelated mean effects models in JAGS. The function `improved_ume()` is also called to ensure a proper accommodation of the multi-arm trials in the unrelated mean effects model. In line with `run_model()`, network meta-regression, multiple pairwise meta-analyses, and sensitivity analysis are fitted in JAGS through the `prepare_model()` function. All model-related functions can be passed as an object to the `mcmc_diagnostics()` function to generate the diagnostic plots and measures for the monitored model 
parameters. 

Figure \@ref(fig:network-models) illustrates the network of the functions developed to prepare the data and conduct NMA and related analyses. Nodes and links refer to functions and the synergy of two functions. The node's size indicates the usability of the corresponding function. For instance, `run_model()` is an over-represented node for having a dual role in the network: it is an object to most functions (e.g., `run_nodesplit()` and `mcmc_diagnostics()`) and depends on other functions to operate (e.g., `data_preparation()` and `prepare_model()`). The node's colour indicates the operationality of the function: most functions perform model implementation (green nodes), followed by functions that contain the BUGS code (blue nodes) or process the dataset and prepare specific arguments (purple nodes) for the corresponding model. The `baseline_model()` function contains all three operationalities, whilst `mcmc_diagnostics()` offers only a set with MCMC diagnostics.

## The visualisation toolkit

Figure \@ref(fig:network-visualisation) displays the network of visualisation-related functions including `run_model()` and various model-related functions. The functions for summarising and presenting results share a common structure: `run_model()` and the model-related function of interest are passed as objects into the corresponding arguments. Consequently, `run_model()` serves as the central node in the network, making it the largest node (Figure \@ref(fig:network-visualisation)). 
The visualisation-related functions are categorised into two groups: the _stand-alone_ and the _platform_ functions. The stand-alone functions are directly responsible for generating specific graphs. For example, `forestplot_metareg()`, and `interval_panel_ume()` are stand-alone functions that solely produce the desired graph using `run_model()` together with `run_metareg()` and `run_ume()`,  as objects in their arguments. Other stand-alone functions depend on a single function to operate; for example, `rankosucra_plot()` and `kld_plot()` use only the `run_model()` and `robustness_index()`, respectively, in their arguments. The platform functions serve as hosts for the stand-alone functions and generate supplementary tables and additional graphs. These functions are easily identifiable in Figure \@ref(fig:network-visualisation), because they are named after the associated model, with *plot* appended to the end of the name. Examples include `nodesplit_plot()`, `ume_plot()`, `metareg_plot()`, and `series_meta_plot()`. For instance, 
`metareg_plot()` calls `scatterplot_sucra()` and `forestplot_sucra()` to produce the intended graphs and displays tables in the console, comparing the effect estimates and predictions from NMA with those from network meta-regression. Every analysis has an individualised visualisation toolkit, indicated by the functions sharing the same colour node (Figure \@ref(fig:network-visualisation)). Only network meta-regression (blue nodes) and conducting separate pairwise meta-analyses (green nodes) share a few stand-alone functions with NMA (grey nodes),
namely, `league_heatmap()` and `league_heatmap_pred()`.
