title: "rnmamod: An R Package for Conducting Bayesian Network Meta-analysis with Missing Participants"
date: "`r Sys.Date()`"
abstract: >
  A plethora of R packages exists for performing network meta-analysis, which has 
  significantly enhanced the popularity of this evidence synthesis methodology. 
  The available R packages facilitate the implementation of the majority of the 
  proposed statistical models to conduct and evaluate network meta-analysis, 
  providing necessary results that conform to the PRISMA-NMA statement. The rnmamod 
  package is a novel contribution to performing aggregate data network meta-analysis 
  using Bayesian methods, as it enables the proper handling of missing participant data  
  in all models, even if a handful of the included studies report this information. 
  Rnmamod is the first R package to offer a rich, user-friendly 
  visualisation toolkit that turns a "parameter-dense" output of network 
  meta-analysis into a collecction of comprehensive graphs. The package further facilitates a 
  thorough appraisal and interpretation of the results, allows the cross-comparison of 
  different models and streamlines the preparation of manuscripts for journal submission.

# Introduction

Evidence-based medicine forms the backbone of informed decisions for the benefit of 
the patients, arising from a meticulous and judicious use of the available evidence. This concept 
incorporates clinical experience and patient values on the basis of the most up-to-date and reliable scientific evidence[@EvidenceBasedMedicine]. 
However, the medical community is daily confronted  with vast amount of clinical evidence to keep pace with, which poses challenges to the optimal practice of evidence-based medicine [@Lee2022].
Systematic reviews with pairwise meta-analysis summarise the evidence of a pair of 
interventions, providing fragmented evidence that does not serve the clinical needs of treatment recommendations based on a plethora of available options. 
Moreover, evidence regarding the comparability of different interventions at the trial 
level is also fragmented, as it is impractical to compare all intervention options 
for a particular condition in signle trial. These limitations led to the development and subsequent 
establishment of network meta-analysis (NMA), also known as multiple treatment 
comparison â€” a new generation evidence synthesis tool [@Salanti2012]. Network 
meta-analysis is the extension of pairwise meta-analysis, collating all relevant 
evidence for a specific condition, patient population, and intervention 
options. The purpose is to provide coherent evidence for all possible intervention comparisons, 
and allow the ranking of the investigated interventions from the most to the least effective
for a given outcome [@Caldwell2014]. Indirect evidence (obtained from different
sets of trials sharing a common investigated intervention/comparator) plays a central role in the development
and prominence of NMA. 

Ever since the introduction of indirect evidence and the initial development of the
corresponding methodology (Higgins and Whitehead 1996; Bucher et al. 1997), the NMA framework has made 
significant conceptual and methodological progress. The rapid publications of pertinent methodological papers and systematic reviews involving multiple interventions bears witness to the growing popularity of NMA
within the broad medical and evidence synthesis community (Efthimiou et al. 2016; Petropoulou et al. 2017). The availability of statistical analysis software has been the driving force behind the progress and widespread dissemination of NMA. A comprehensive review of NMA methodology and software (Efthimiou et al. 2016) listed several 
statistical software tools that have been instrumental in promoting NMA. Among these tools, the \textbf{R} software (R Core Team 2023) takes the lead as the most widely utilized, followed by \textbf{Stata} (StataCorp 2021) and \textbf{SAS software} (SAS Institute 2020). In the past decade, there has been a surge in the development of R packages tailored for NMA, each offering distinct functionalities (Dewey and Viechtbauer 2023).

Most methodological studies and systematic reviews involving NMA have employed
Bayesian methods [@GetRealNMA; @Petropoulou2017]. The advantages of the Bayesian 
framework (e.g., flexible modeling, allowing uncertainty in all model parameters, 
incorporation of external relevant information and facilitation of probabilistic 
statements) [@Sutton2001], coupled with the dominance of the BUGS software 
[@Lunn2009] during the springtime of the NMA framework, may have contributed to 
the growing popularity of Bayesian NMA. The numerous Bayesian NMA R packages
also demonstrate the recognition of Bayesian methods within the evidence synthesis 
community [@CRANTaskReview]. The rest of the section delves into R packages for 
Bayesian NMA published in the __CRAN Task View 'Meta-Analysis'__ [@CRANTaskReview] 
featuring a wide range of methodological and reporting functionalities: \CRANpkg{bnma} [@bnma], 
\CRANpkg{gemtc} [@gemtc], \CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} [@pcnetmeta], and \CRANpkg{rnmamod} 
[@rnmamod] (a recent novel contribution).

The R packages \CRANpkg{bnma} [@bnma], \CRANpkg{gemtc} [@gemtc], and \CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} 
[@pcnetmeta] perform hierarchical NMA using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods 
through the __JAGS__ program [@Plummer2003]. However, they differ in terms of their 
methodological and reporting scope: the former two share a greater common basis in methods and outputs 
than \CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} [@pcnetmeta]. This may be attributed to adoption of difference modelling approaches.
\CRANpkg{bnma} [@bnma] and \CRANpkg{gemtc} [@gemtc] employ the contrast-based approach, where
trial-specific relative effects, such as log odds ratio, are 
pooled across trials. This is the most established approach to meta-analysis, while
\CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} [@pcnetmeta] adopts the arm-based modeling approach, where 
arm-specific results, such as log odds, are pooled across trials. This approach
deviates from the standard meta-analysis practice [@Dias2016] and is less widespread. 

Currently, the \CRANpkg{pcnetmeta} [@pcnetmeta] package lacks functions for performing inconsistency evaluation 
and meta-regression. Also, it is limited to only rankograms in terms of hierarchy
measures [@Salanti2022], and considers solely trace plots as a visual diagnostic tool. 
On the contrary, \CRANpkg{bnma} [@bnma] and \CRANpkg{gemtc} [@gemtc] offer at least 
one method for inconsistency evaluation and meta-regression, and provide a wider variety of hierarchy measures
and diagnostic tools. All three R packages provide a compact toolkit 
of functions for presenting the relative treatment effects results: a league 
table for one outcome, typically displayed only in the console, and a forest-plot or table 
on the relative treatment effects of all comparisons versus a selected reference intervention.
Moreover, these packages provide most output using the `print()` function (the results appear in the 
console) than utilising visualisation. Consequently, the results are often presented in isolation, thereby limiting
the ability to gain further insights into the performance of the different NMA models 
(e.g, assuming consistency versus inconsistency). 

Given the complexity and the broad scope of NMA, researchers are faced with 
a substantial volume of results that are essential for understanding the evidence base. This involves
evaluating underlying assumptions and assessing the quality of the estimated parameters (via model 
diagnostics) to properly provide a response to the investigated research question. 
The aforementioned R packages have limited functionalities when it comes to presentation of NMA results.
As a result, meticulously examining and critically appraising the results, a necessary requirement to ensure the transparency
of conclusions delivered to the end users of systematic reviews including multiple interventions, presents a considerable challenge.
Furthermore, an overreliance on the R console limits the usability of the results. R users are required 
to resort to tabulation, which hampers comprehension, especially when analysing extensive intervention networks that inherently yield an immense amount 
of results. Alternatively, R users must write functions to produce the 
necessary visualisations, a time-consuming process that heavily relies on the user's programming skills in R.
The R  package __rnmamod__ [@rnmamod], recently published in the Comprehensive R Archive 
Network (available at 
[https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnmamod](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rnmamod)),
aspires to fill this technical gap by offering a rich, dynamic, user-friendly 
visualisation toolkit that transforms the inherently dense output of NMA into a collection of  
coherent graphs. Originally, the __rnmamod__ package was inspired by the absence of dedicated 
R packages that properly account for (aggregate) missing participants in the analyses 
underlying the NMA framework (e.g., core model, inconsistency assessment, and 
meta-regression). 

The article introduces the R package __rnmamod__ that performs Bayesian 
hierarchical NMA in JAGS through the R package \CRANpkg{R2jags} [@R2jags],
while modeling missing participants using one-stage pattern-mixture models [@Little1993].
The package's visualisation functionalities has been developed using the R package 
\CRANpkg{ggplot2} [@ggplot2] harnessing the flexibility it offers in creating 
and customising high-quality graphs. The rest of this article is structured as 
follows. Section [2](#Pattern-mixture-models-for-aggregate-binary-and-continuous-outcomes) 
provides an overview of the pattern-mixture models for aggregate binary and continuous 
outcome data within the context of NMA. Section [3](#The-architecture-of-\pkg{rnmamod}) 
outlines the architecture of __rnmamod__. Section [4](#Bayesian-network-meta-analysis-model) 
describes the Bayesian network meta-analysis model and introduces the robustness 
index, a novel approach to investigate the sensitivity of the analysis results to 
different scenarios about the missing mechanism in the interventions of the investigated 
network [@SpineliRSM2021; @SpineliBMCMed2021]. 
In section [5](#Using-the-\pkg{rnmamod}-R-package) we illustrate the various functions of the package on example 
datasets from published systematic reviews with NMA. Finally, Section [6](#Discussion) 
concludes with a discussion on the limitations and future developments of the package. 

# Pattern-mixture model for aggregate binary and continuous outcomes

We briefly introduce the pattern-mixture model, originally proposed by Little 
[@Little1993], and extend it to a summary binary and continuous outcome in the
evidence synthesis framework. The pattern-mixture model distinguishes the participants 
to those completing and those leaving the assigned intervention arm prematurely 
for several reasons. The former are called _completers_ and the latter 
_missing participants_. There is information only on the outcome of the completers 
for remaining to the assigned intervention until trial completion. If missing 
participants are not followed-up after leaving the trial, which is usually the case,
their outcome can only be hypothesised with some uncertainty; hence, we can determine 
a distribution of possible values to describe the hypothetical outcome of missing
participants in the assigned intervention. Ideally, this distribution should be elicited
using an expert opinion for the investigated outcome and interventions [@White2007]. 
Then, the weighted average of the observed and hypothesised outcomes, using the 
proportion of completers and missing participants as the corresponding weights, 
yields the _true_ outcome for all randomised participants receiving the investigated 
intervention. This corresponds to the intention-to-treat analysis, and it is of 
particular interest to investigate the impact to the treatment effect of different 
scenarios about the distribution of hypothetical outcome values for the missing 
participants. This sensitivity analysis is at the core of the literature on 
handling missing data properly [@White2007; @Carpenter2007; @NationalResearchCouncil].

Consider a set of $N$ trials collected using a systematic review process. These 
trials investigate different sets of two or more carefully-selected interventions 
for a specific target population and clinical condition. We extract information on 
the number randomised, the number of completers and missing participants, and the 
measured outcome from each arm of every trial. The pattern-mixture framework models 
completers and missing participants simultaneously, maintaining the randomised
sample, as follows:

$$
\theta_{ik} = \theta^{c}_{ik} \times (1 - q_{ik}) + \theta^{m}_{ik} \times q_{ik} 
\tag{1}
$$

where $\theta_{ik}$ is the true outcome in arm $k$ of trial $i$, $\theta^{c}_{ik}$
and $\theta^{m}_{ik}$ are the outcomes among the completers and missing participants,
respectively (the superscripts $c$ and $m$ stand for completers and missing), and 
$q_{ik}$ is the proportion of missing participants. It holds that 

$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{ik} &= P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 1 \cup M_{ikj} = 0) \\
\theta^{c}_{ik} &= P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 0) \\
\theta^{m}_{ik} &= P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 1) \\
\end{aligned}$$

for a binary outcome, and 

$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{ik} &= E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 1 \cup M_{ikj} = 0) \\
\theta^{c}_{ik} &= E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 0) \\
\theta^{m}_{ik} &= E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 1) \\
\end{aligned}$$

for a continuous outcome, with $I_{ikj}$ and $M_{ikj}$ being dummy variables 
referring to whether a participant $j$ experienced the outcome or left the trial
prematurely, respectively, and $Y_{ikj}$ referring to the continuous outcome of 
participant $j$.

## Informative missingness parameters

It has been suggested in the relevant published literature to replace the missingness 
parameter $\theta^{m}_{ik}$ with the following parameters to measure the informative 
missingness as a function of the outcome in completers and missing participants
[@White2008; @Mavridis2015; @Turner2015]:

$$\begin{aligned}
\phi_{ik} = logit(\theta^{m}_{ik}) - logit(\theta^{c}_{ik})
\end{aligned}$$

the informative missingness odds ratio (IMOR) in the logarithmic scale for binary 
outcomes [@White2008; @Turner2015], and 

$$\begin{aligned}
\psi_{ik} = \theta^{m}_{ik} - \theta^{c}_{ik}
\end{aligned}$$

the informative missingness difference of means (IMDoM) for continuous outcomes 
[@Mavridis2015]. Other informative missingness parameters that have been suggested 
for binary outcomes are the response probability ratio [@Magder2003; @Turner2015] 
defined as the ratio of the probability of completing the trial given the outcome 
being experienced to the probability of completing the trial given the outcome 
not being experienced,

$$\begin{aligned}
\omega_{ik} = \dfrac{P(M_{ikj} = 0 | I_{ikj} = 1)}{P(M_{ikj} = 0 | I_{ikj} = 0)}
\end{aligned}$$

and the success probability ratio [@Akl2013; @Turner2015] as the ratio of the 
probability of experiencing the outcome given the missing participants to the 
probability of experiencing the outcome given the completers,

$$\begin{aligned}
\rho_{ik} = \dfrac{\theta^{m}_{ik}}{\theta^{c}_{ik}} = \dfrac{P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 1)}{P(I_{ikj} = 1 | M_{ikj} = 0)}.
\end{aligned}$$

Finally, the informative missingness ratio of means (IMRoM) has also been suggested 
for the continuous outcomes [@Mavridis2015] defined as the mean outcome given the 
missing participants to the mean outcome given the completers,

$$\begin{aligned}
\zeta_{ik} = \dfrac{\theta^{m}_{ik}}{\theta^{c}_{ik}} = \dfrac{E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 1)}{E(Y_{ikj} | M_{ikj} = 0)}.
\end{aligned}$$

The response probability ratio [@Magder2003; @Turner2015] aligns better with a 
selection model that distinguishes the participants based on their outcome and 
then further distinguishes between those completing and those leaving the assigned 
intervention prematurely [@Little1995]. The success probability ratio [@Akl2013; 
@Turner2015] is more likely to be used with the risk ratio for also being a ratio 
of risks. The IMRoM is intuitively related to the ratio of means [@Mavridis2015]. 
Finally, IMOR and IMDoM are more likely to be used in conjunction to the OR and 
the mean difference (MD) and standardised mean difference (SMD), respectively. 
In this article, we will consider only the IMOR and IMDoM due to their intuitive 
relation to the aforementioned effect measures which are also the most frequently 
used in published systematic reviews and relevant methodological literature 
[@Friedrich2008; @Nikolakopoulou2014; @Bakbergenuly2019].

The informative missingness parameters IMDoM and IMOR in the logarithmic scale 
(log IMOR) take values in ${\rm I\!R}$ with zero implying the missing at random
(MAR) assumption (ignorable missingness) and non-zero values indicating the missing 
not at random assumption (non-ignorable missingness). Essentially, the informative 
missingness parameters quantify departures from the missing at random assumption. 
Since these parameters are unknown, the analysts can consider one of the following 
situations: 

* assign a fixed value, which corresponds to imputation [@Higgins2008; @Turner2015; @Spineli2019],
* assume a distribution with suggested parameter values and proceed with a two-stage 
approach to synthesise the trials using their adjusted treatment effects and variances 
for missing participants obtained through the Taylor series approximation in the 
first stage [@White2008; @Mavridis2015], or 
* use the Bayesian framework to estimate their posterior distribution via an one-stage 
approach to synthesise the trials [@Turner2015; @Spineli2019; @Spineli2021]. 

Typically, a normal distribution is assigned on both informative missingness parameters 
[@Higgins2008; @White2008; @Mavridis2015; @Turner2015; @Spineli2019; @Spineli2021]. 
In the Bayesian framework, the analysts assign a prior normal distribution on these 
parameters and can determine the mean and variance of the normal distribution to 
be common across the trials and intervention arms, specific to the interventions or 
trials, as well as identical, hierarchical or independent [@Turner2015; @Spineli2019; 
@Spineli2021]. Table 
`r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(tab:table-one-interactive)', '\\@ref(tab:table-one)'))` presents the different structural specifications of 
log IMOR, IMDoM and log IMRoM. The __rnmamod__ package allows the user to apply 
all structural specifications for log IMOR, IMDoM and log IMRoM.

# Bayesian network meta-analysis model

Suppose the $N$ trials compare different sets of $T$ interventions ${A, B, C,..., T}$:
the network of interventions is made up from two-arm trials and probably 
multi-arm trials, as well, and the network is connected; namely, there is no 
intervention or group of interventions forming a separate network. For a binary
outcome, we extract information on the number of participants who experience the
outcome in arm $k$ ($k \ge 1$) of trial $i$ and completed the trial, $r^{c}_{ik}$, 
and the number of missing participants, $m_{ik}$, out of the total randomised, 
$n_{ik}$. Following the notation from the precious section, $r^{c}_{ik}$ and $m_{ik}$ 
are assumed to be sampled from the corresponding binomial distributions:

$$\begin{aligned}
r^{c}_{ik} \sim Binomial(\theta^{c}_{ik}, c_{ik})  
\end{aligned}$$

and

$$\begin{aligned}
m_{ik} \sim Binomial(q_{ik}, n_{ik})  
\end{aligned}$$

with $\theta^{c}_{ik}$ and $c_{ik}$ being the underlying probability of event 
among the completers and the number of completers, respectively, in arm $k$ of 
trial $i$. In the case of a continuous outcome, the extracted information pertains 
to the average outcome and variance thereof among those completing arm $k$ of trial 
$i$, $y^{c}_{ik}$ and $v^{c}_{ik}$, respectively, and $m_{ik}$ out of $n_{ik}$. 
Then, it can be assumed that $y^{c}_{ik}$ is samples from the following normal 
distribution:

$$\begin{aligned}
y^{c}_{ik} \sim N(\theta^{c}_{ik}, v^{c}_{ik})  
\end{aligned}$$

with $\theta^{c}_{ik}$ being the underlying mean of the continuous outcome among 
the completers in arm $k$ of trial $i$. 

Returning to the binary outcome, the underlying logit of an event in the experimental
arm $k$ of trial $i$, $logit(\theta_{ik})$, is a function of the baseline logit of
an event in trial $i$, $u_{i} = logit(\theta_{i1})$,
and the odds ratio of event between arm $k$ and the baseline arm in the logarithmic 
scale, $\delta_{ik}$:

$$\begin{aligned}
logit(\theta_{ik}) = u_{i} + \delta_{ik} \times I\{k \ne 1\}   
\end{aligned}$$

The parameter $\theta_{ik}$ has been adjusted for missing participants using the 
pattern-mixture model (equation \@ref(eq1)) with $\phi_{ik}$ for informative 
missingness parameter under a specific prior structure and assumption about the 
missingness mechanism reflected by the mean of the prior distribution (see Table 
`r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(tab:table-one-interactive)', '\\@ref(tab:table-one)'))`). 

The link function for the continuous outcome is the following:

$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{ik} = u_{i} + \delta_{ik} \times I\{k \ne 1\}      
\end{aligned}$$

with $\theta_{ik}$ and $u_{i} = \theta_{i1}$ being the underlying mean outcome in 
arm $k$ and baseline arm of trial $i$, respectively, and $\delta_{ik}$ being the 
MD between arm $k$ and baseline arm of the trial. When SMD is the effect measure, 
the link function is written as follows:

$$\begin{aligned}
\theta_{ik} = u_{i} + S_{i} \times \delta_{ik} \times I\{k \ne 1\}      
\end{aligned}$$

with $S_{i}$ being the pooled standard deviation under the MAR assumption when 
trial $i$ has missing participants. In this case, the variance of the outcome among 
the completers is assumed to be equal to the variance of the outcome among the 
missing participants [@Spineli2021]. To acknowledge the uncertainty about this 
assumption, $S_{i}$ is assumed to be sampled from the following gamma distribution 
[@Stevens2011; @Spineli2021]:

$$\begin{aligned}
S^{2}_{i} \sim \Gamma\left(\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{a_{i}}(n_{ik} - 1)}{2}, \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{a_{i}}(n_{ik} - 1)}{2 \times v^{c}_{ik}}\right)  
\end{aligned}$$

Like with the binary outcome, $\theta_{ik}$ has been adjusted for missing participants 
using the pattern-mixture model (equation \@ref(eq1)) with $\psi_{ik}$ for informative 
missingness parameter under a specific prior structure and assumption about the 
missingness mechanism reflected by the mean of the prior distribution (see Table 
`r knitr::asis_output(ifelse(knitr::is_html_output(), '\\@ref(tab:table-one-interactive)', '\\@ref(tab:table-one)'))`).

## Sensitivity analysis to different missingness scenarios

# The architecture of \pkg{rnmamod}

## Functions on data preparation and model implementation

The `run_model()` function has a central role in the architecture of the __rnmamod__ 
package. It is the function of conducting the core NMA model and related analyses 
to assess the underlying assumptions of NMA. It also comprises the object of most 
functions to create the necessary visualisations. Initially, `run_model()` calls 
the `data_preparation()` function to prepare the dataset in the proper format to 
fit the model in JAGS. The dataset is provided in the one-study-per-row format, 
typical for codes written in the BUGS language. Then `run_model()` bundles the 
dataset and the necessary parameters (they have been processed through the 
`missingness_param_prior()`, `heterogeneity_param_prior()`, and `baseline_model()` 
functions) to conduct NMA through the `prepare_model()` function. The `prepare_model()` 
function contains the code in BUGS language to conduct a hierarchical one-stage 
NMA, as published by the NICE Decision Support Unit in a series of tutorial papers 
on evidence synthesis methods for decision-making [@Dias2013]. The `missingness_param_prior()` 
and `heterogeneity_param_prior()` functions process the hyperparameters of the 
selected prior distribution for the informative missingness parameter and the 
between-study heterogeneity parameter, respectively, to be read by JAGS. 
The `baseline_model()` function is relevant only in the case of a binary outcome. 
It processes the baseline risk defined by the user or the default option before 
conducting NMA. 

Subsequent analyses associated with the underlying assumptions of NMA are performed 
by specially devised functions that inherit most arguments from `run_model()`. 
Therefore, careful specification of the arguments in `run_model()` is essential 
for the contingent functions to yield sensible results and ensure meaningful 
comparison with the NMA results. These functions refer to the local and global 
consistency evaluation (`run_nodesplit()` and `run_ume()`), network meta-regression 
(`run_metareg()`), multiple pairwise meta-analyses (`run_series_meta()`) and 
sensitivity analysis to different missingness scenarios (`run_sensitivity()`) when 
the number of missing participants has been extracted for all study-arms. 
The functions `run_nodesplit()` and `run_ume()` call the `prepare_nodesplit()` and 
`prepare_ume()` functions, respectively, to fit the node-splitting and the unrelated 
mean effects models in JAGS. The function `improved_ume()` is also called to ensure 
a proper accommodation of the multi-arm trials in the unrelated mean effects model. 
In line with `run_model()`, network meta-regression, multiple pairwise meta-analyses, 
and sensitivity analysis are fitted in JAGS through the `prepare_model()` function. 
All model-related functions can be passed as an object to the `mcmc_diagnostics()` 
function to generate the diagnostic plots and measures for the monitored model 
parameters. 

Figure \@ref(fig:network-models) illustrates the network of the functions 
developed to prepare the data and conduct NMA and related analyses. Nodes and links 
refer to functions and the synergy of two functions. The node's  size indicates 
the usability of the corresponding function. For instance, `run_model()` is an 
over-represented node for having a dual role in the network: it is an object 
to most functions (e.g., `run_nodesplit()` and `mcmc_diagnostics()`) and depends 
on other functions to operate (e.g., `data_preparation()` and `prepare_model()`).
The node's colour indicates the operationality of the function: most functions 
perform model implementation (green nodes), followed by functions that contain 
the BUGS code (blue nodes) or process the dataset and prepare specific arguments 
(purple nodes) for the corresponding model. The `baseline_model()` function contains 
all three operationalities, whilst `mcmc_diagnostics()` offers only a set with 
MCMC diagnostics.

## The visualisation toolkit

Figure \@ref(fig:network-visualisation) presents the network of visualisation-related 
functions alongside `run_model()` and several model-related functions. The 
functions associated with summarising and presenting the results have a common 
structure: `run_model()` and the model-related function of interest are passed as 
objects into the corresponding arguments. Hence, `run_model()` comprises the backbone 
of the network and forms the largest node (Figure \@ref(fig:network-visualisation)). 
The visualisation-related functions are distinguished into the _stand-alone_ and 
the _platform_ functions. The stand-alone functions are immediately related to 
generating the relevant graphs. For instance, `forestplot_metareg()`, and `interval_panel_ume()` 
constitute stand-alone functions and return only the intended graph using `run_model()` 
together with `run_metareg()` and `run_ume()`, respectively, as objects in their 
arguments. Other stand-alone functions depend on a single function to operate; 
for example, `rankosucra_plot()` and `kld_plot()` use only the `run_model()` and 
`robustness_index()`, respectively, in their arguments. The platform functions 
host the stand-alone functions and generate complementary tables and further graphs. 
They are easy to spot in Figure \@ref(fig:network-visualisation), as they are named 
after the related model, with the *plot* affixed at the end: `nodesplit_plot()`, 
`ume_plot()`, `metareg_plot()`, and `series_meta_plot()`. For instance, 
`metareg_plot()` calls `scatterplot_sucra()` and `forestplot_sucra()` to return 
the corresponding intended graphs and prints tables in the console where the 
effect estimates and predictions from NMA are juxtaposed with those from network 
meta-regression. Every analysis has an individualised visualisation toolkit, 
indicated by the functions sharing the same colour node (Figure \@ref(fig:network-visualisation)). 
Only network meta-regression (blue nodes) and conducting separate pairwise 
meta-analyses (green nodes) share a few stand-alone functions with NMA (grey nodes), 
namely, `league_heatmap()` and `league_heatmap_pred()`.
